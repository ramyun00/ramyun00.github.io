# Hi

I originally made this in a couple days to send as part of a job application.
I've been updating it over time to improve the look, but I'm clearer no designer ðŸ˜‚
I have a vanity domain as well, but realized I had put a Google Cloud service test there (and it's still there at [annaboot.com](http://annaboot.com)), so I decided to deploy this to Github Pages since there's a nice library that builds and deploys it for you called gh-pages.

# Interests

My primary areas of interest are front-end development, especially React and React Native applications. I am also learning about Google Cloud products and Unity development for the purpose of building AR/VR applications.

# Work

I worked for IBM as a front-end developer and consultant for 10 years. I'm currently interested in developing my own applications and freelance/contract work.
